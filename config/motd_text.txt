                         469AD's ephemeral DoD:S server

                      A friendly server for mediocre players.

Don't want to need a lot of rules and stuff, so like, just be chill, and don't bring your negative energy in here.

Otherwise it's probably less hassle to kick people than deal with them spoiling our afternoon.

                         Weekends: 11am to 11pm GMT+10


              THE SERVER CRASHES PRETTY OFTEN SINCE THE UPDATE
             It'll restart in just a few moments - please rejoin.
